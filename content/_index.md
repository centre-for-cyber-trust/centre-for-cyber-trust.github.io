We all use the Internet for our personal and business communications, but we are all too happy to crowd out the terrifying truth: the Internet can be crippled by criminals and hostile states, even by individual companies, in no time at all.

At the Center for Cyber Trust, we work on solutions that **increase trust, sovereignty, and transparency** of the modern Internet, digital communication, and digital interactions.
A basic principle of our solutions are the close connection between the physical and the digital world.
On the one hand, we use verifiable facts of the physical world as the basis for
relationships of trust in the digital world; On the other hand, we also use the new security mechanisms
of the digital world to secure conventional, physical communication.
