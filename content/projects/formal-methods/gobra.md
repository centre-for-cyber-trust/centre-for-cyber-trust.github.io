Gobra is an automated, modular verifier for Go programs, based on the Viper verification infrastructure.

Go is targeted at high performance applications running in potentially distributed settings and on multicore machines. Hence, Go provides some built-​​in concurrency primitives, like channel-​based communication. Gobra is intended to verify correctness and security properties of such programs, scaling to substantial codebases.
