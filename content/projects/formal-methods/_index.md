At the Centre for Cyber Trust, we use Formal Methods to establish certainty that our designs work as intended and in presence of powerful adversaries, and we advance Formal Methods to push the boundaries of what is possible.

For example, we applied Formal Methods to our projects [ADEM](/homepage/projects/adem) and [SOAP](/homepage/projects/secure-messaging).

A list of projects that advance Formal Methods is shown below.
